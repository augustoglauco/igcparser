# IGC Parser

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/FJcSf4q.png" height="35%" width="35%"">

This is an open source project that includes so far:
- An Android library to parse IGC files.
- An Android app to friendly view IGC files.

The project is under heavy development, that's why I recommend you to not use it on production ready products. 

You are more than welcome to contribute here. For example, it would be great to have this running on Java or other languages and platforms.
